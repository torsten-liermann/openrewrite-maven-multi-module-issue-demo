This demo project illustrate a potential issue with OpenRewrite in a multi-module Maven project.
The project comprises two modules, `module-01` and `module-02`, each containing the following plugin configuration in their respective `pom.xml` files:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
            <artifactId>jaxb2-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.5.0</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

The OpenRewrite recipe (`demo-009`) is defined as follows:

```yaml
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: demo-009
preconditions:
  - org.openrewrite.maven.search.FindPlugin:
      groupId: org.codehaus.mojo
      artifactId: jaxb2-maven-plugin
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.maven.AddDependency:
      groupId: jakarta.xml.bind
      artifactId: jakarta.xml.bind-api
      version: 4.0.*
```

**Observed Behavior:**

Upon executing the OpenRewrite recipe, the `jakarta.xml.bind:jakarta.xml.bind-api` dependency is added to `module-02` as expected. However, it is not added to `module-01`.

**Project Structure:**

```
/
├── pom.xml           (Aggregator POM)
├── parent/
│   └── pom.xml       (Parent POM)
├── module-01/
│   └── pom.xml       (with Parent relationship)
└── module-02/
    └── pom.xml       (without Parent relationship)
```

- **Aggregator POM (pom.xml`):** Serves as the aggregator for all modules but does not function as a parent.
- **Parent POM (`parent/pom.xml`):** Defines shared configurations and is referenced as the parent by `module-01`.
- **`module-01/pom.xml`:** Inherits from the `parent` POM.
- **`module-02/pom.xml`:** Does not inherit from any parent POM.

**Running the Recipe from the Command Line**
```bash
mvn org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:LATEST:run -Drewrite.activeRecipes=demo-009
```

This placement ensures that users understand how to run the recipe after configuring it.

- **Possible Cause:**

It appears that the OpenRewrite recipe does not recognize the plugin configuration inherited from the `parent/pom.xml` in `module-01`. Consequently, the precondition (`FindPlugin`) fails, and the dependency is not added.
